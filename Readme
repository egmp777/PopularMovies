This is my Popular Movies App for Project1. 
Author: Elena Eidson
Displays a list of movie posters in its main screen. 
When the user clicks/pads on a poster a new screen appears with details about the movie.

Notes:
Please place the The Movie Database API_KEY in the MainActivity classâ€™s loadMovieData() method as a field called apiKey, which will then be passed to the execute async task as follows:
 
        new FetcMovieTask().execute(apiKey);
