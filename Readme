This is my Popular Movies App for Project1. 
Author: Elena Eidson
Displays a list of movie posters in its main screen. 
When the user clicks/pads on a poster a new screen appears with details about the movie.

Notes:
I am placing the API key for The Movie Database in a private gradle.properties file.
